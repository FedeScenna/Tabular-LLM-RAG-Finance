# Project Refactoring

This document explains the refactoring that was done to improve the organization and maintainability of the Financial Assistant project.

## Original Structure

The original project had a flat structure with several files in the `rag` directory:

- `app.py`: Main application file
- `stock_data.py`: Stock data analysis functionality
- `utils.py`: Utility functions
- `process_documents.py`: Document processing functionality

## New Structure

The project has been refactored into a proper Python package with a clear separation of concerns:

```
financial-rag-assistant/
├── data/                  # Data directory for stock prices and documents
├── embeddings/            # Generated embeddings from documents
├── financial_assistant/   # Main package
│   ├── __init__.py        # Package initialization
│   ├── app.py             # Streamlit application entry point
│   ├── document_processing/  # Document processing modules
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── processor.py   # PDF processing functionality
│   ├── rag/               # RAG functionality
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── engine.py      # RAG engine implementation
│   ├── stock_analysis/    # Stock analysis modules
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── analyzer.py    # Stock data analysis functionality
│   └── utils/             # Utility functions
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── helpers.py     # Helper functions
├── scripts/               # Utility scripts
│   └── process_documents.py  # Script to process documents and create embeddings
├── run.py                 # Entry point script
├── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Architecture**: The code is now organized into logical modules with clear responsibilities.
2. **Proper Documentation**: Each module, class, and function has proper docstrings explaining its purpose and usage.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: The application logic is separated from the data processing and analysis functionality.
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error handling and debugging information throughout the codebase.
5. **Consistent Coding Style**: Consistent coding style and naming conventions.
6. **Entry Point Script**: A simple entry point script to run the application.
7. **Comprehensive README**: A detailed README file explaining the project, its features, and how to use it.

## Module Descriptions

### `financial_assistant.app`

The main application file that integrates all the components and provides the user interface.

### `financial_assistant.document_processing.processor`

Handles the processing of PDF documents and creation of embeddings for the RAG system.

### `financial_assistant.rag.engine`

Provides the core RAG functionality, including loading vector stores and creating conversation chains.

### `financial_assistant.stock_analysis.analyzer`

Handles the analysis of stock price data, including loading, processing, and visualization.

### `financial_assistant.utils.helpers`

Provides utility functions used throughout the application.

### `scripts.process_documents`

A command-line script to process documents and create embeddings.

## Usage

To run the application:

```bash
python run.py
```

To process documents:

```bash
python -m scripts.process_documents --input_dir /path/to/pdf --output_dir embeddings
```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Easier Maintenance**: The modular structure makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase.
2. **Better Collaboration**: Clear separation of concerns makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the project.
3. **Improved Readability**: The code is now more readable and easier to understand.
4. **Enhanced Extensibility**: The modular architecture makes it easier to add new features.
5. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation makes it easier for new developers to understand the project.
