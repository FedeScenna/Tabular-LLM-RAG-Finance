      "3M Company (originally the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company) is an American multinational conglomerate operating in the fields of industry, worker safety, and consumer goods.[5] The company produces over 60,000 products under several brands,[6] including adhesives, abrasives, laminates, passive fire protection, personal protective equipment, window films, paint protection film, electrical, electronic connecting, insulating materials, car-care products,[7] electronic circuits, and optical films.[8] It is based in Maplewood, a suburb of Saint Paul, Minnesota.[9]\n",
      "3M made $35.4 billion in total sales in 2021 and ranked number 102 in the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[10] As of 2021[update], the company had approximately 95,000 employees and operations in more than 70 countries.[11] There are a few international subsidiaries, such as 3M India, 3M Japan, and 3M Canada.[12]\n",
      "In June 2023, 3M reached a settlement to pay more than $10 billion to US public water systems to resolve claims over the company's contamination of water with PFASs (so-called forever chemicals).[13] It has been revealed that the company knew of the health harms of PFAS in the 1990s, yet concealed these harms and continues to sell contaminated products.[14][15]\n",
      "Five businessmen founded the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company as a mining venture in Two Harbors, Minnesota, making their first sale on June 13, 1902.[1] The goal was to mine corundum, but this failed because the mine's mineral holdings were anorthosite, which had no commercial value. Co-founder John Dwan solicited funds in exchange for stock and Edgar Ober and Lucius Ordway took over the company in 1905. The company moved to Duluth and began researching and producing sandpaper products. William L. McKnight, later a key executive, joined the company in 1907, and A.Â G. Bush joined in 1909. 3M finally became financially stable in 1916 and was able to pay dividends.[16]\n",
      "The company moved to Saint Paul in 1910, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Center in Maplewood, Minnesota, in 1962.[17]\n",
      "In 1947, 3M began producing perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) by electrochemical fluorination.[18] In 1951, DuPont purchased PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company for use in the manufacturing of teflon, a product that brought DuPont a billion-dollar-a-year profit by the 1990s.[19] DuPont referred to PFOA as C8.[20] The original formula for Scotchgard, a water repellent applied to fabrics, was discovered accidentally in 1952 by 3M chemists Patsy Sherman and Samuel Smith. Sales began in 1956, and in 1973 the two chemists received a patent for the formula.[21][22]\n",
      "In the late 1950s, 3M produced the first asthma inhaler,[23] but the company did not enter the pharmaceutical industry until the mid-1960s with the acquisition of Riker Laboratories, moving it from California to Minnesota.[24] 3M retained the Riker Laboratories name for the subsidiary until at least 1985.[25] In the mid-1990s, 3M Pharmaceuticals, as the division came to be called, produced the first CFC-free asthma inhaler in response to adoption of the Montreal Protocol by the United States.[26][27] In the 1980s and 1990s, the company spent fifteen years developing a topical cream delivery technology which led in 1997 to health authority approval and marketing of a symptomatic treatment for genital warts, Aldara.[28][29] 3M divested its pharmaceutical unit through three deals in 2006, netting more than US$2 billion.[30][31] At the time, 3M Pharmaceuticals comprised about 20% of 3M's healthcare business and employed just over a thousand people.[30]\n",
      "By the 1970s, 3M developed a theatrical blood formula based on red colorfast microbeads suspended in a carrier liquid.[32] This stage blood was sold as Nextel Simulated Blood[32][33] and was used during the production of the 1978 film Dawn of the Dead.[34] It has since been discontinued.[33]\n",
      "In the late 1970s, 3M Mincom was involved in some of the first digital audio recordings to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. In 1979 3M introduced a digital audio recording system called \"3M Digital Audio Mastering System\".[35]\n",
      "In 1980, the company acquired Comtal, a manufacturer of digital image processors.[36]\n",
      "3M launched \"Press 'n Peel\" a sticky bookmark page holder in stores in four cities in 1977, but the results were disappointing.[37][38] A year later 3M instead issued free samples of it as a sticky note directly to consumers in Boise, Idaho, with 95% of those who tried them indicating they would buy the product.[37] The product was sold as \"Post-Its\" in 1979 when the rollout introduction began,[39] and was sold across the United States[39] from April 6, 1980.[40] The following year they were launched in Canada and Europe.[41]\n",
      "On April 8, 2002, 3M's 100th anniversary, the company changed its legal name to \"3M Company\".[42][43] On September 8, 2008, 3M announced an agreement to acquire Meguiar's, a car-care products company that was family-owned for over a century.[44] In August 2010, 3M acquired Cogent Systems for $943 million,[45] and on October 13, 2010, 3M completed acquisition of Arizant Inc.[46] In December 2011, 3M completed the acquisition of the Winterthur Technology Group, a bonded abrasives company.\n",
      "As of 2012, 3M was one of the 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, added on August 9, 1976, and was 97 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list.[47] On January 3, 2012, it was announced that the Office and Consumer Products Division of Avery Dennison was being bought by 3M for $550 million.[48] The transaction was canceled by 3M in September 2012 amid antitrust concerns.[49]\n",
      "In May 2013, 3M sold Scientific Anglers and Ross Reels to Orvis. Ross Reels had been acquired by 3M in 2010.[50]\n",
      "In March 2017, 3M purchased Johnson Controls International Plc's safety gear business, Scott Safety, for $2 billion.[51]\n",
      "In 2017, 3M had net sales for the year of $31.657 billion, up from $30.109 billion the year before.[52] In 2018, it was reported that the company would pay $850 million to end the Minnesota water pollution case concerning perfluorochemicals.[53]\n",
      "On May 25, 2018, Michael F. Roman was appointed CEO by the board of directors.[54] On December 19, 2018, 3M announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the technology business of M*Modal, for a total enterprise value of $1.0 billion.[55]\n",
      "In October 2019, 3M purchased Acelity and its KCI subsidiaries for $6.7 billion, including assumption of debt and other adjustments.[56]\n",
      "On May 1, 2020, 3M divested substantially all of its drug delivery business to an affiliate of Altaris Capital Partners, LLC. for approximately $650 million, including a 17% interest in the new operating company, Kindeva Drug Delivery.[57]\n",
      "In December 2021, 3M announced that it would merge its food-safety business with food testing and animal healthcare products maker Neogen.[58] The deal, with an enterprise value of about $5.3 billion,[58] closed in September 2022.[59]\n",
      "In July 2022, the company announced it would spin off its healthcare assets to form a new, independent firm, likely completing the transaction in 2023.[60] 3M will retain an ownership stake of 19.9% in the new, publicly-traded health care company and gradually divest the holdings.[60][61] The company will be known as Solventum Corporation.[62]\n",
      "In December 2022, the company announced plans to stop producing and using so-called forever chemicals (per and polyfluoroalkyl[63]), which have been commonly used in items such as food packaging, cellphones, nonstick pans, firefighting foams, and clothing. These chemicals are well known for their water-resistant and nonstick properties, but they are also dangerous pollutants that are linked to serious health problems, including ulcerative colitis and cancer.[64][65] The move comes as governments in the Netherlands and the United States consider actions against 3M.[66][67]\n",
      "In March 2024, 3M announced the appointment of William \"Bill\" Brown as chief executive officer to take effect on May 1, 2024. Michael Roman would remain in the role of executive chairman. Brown, 61, is the former chairman of the board and chief executive officer of L3Harris Technologies.[68]\n",
      "As of 2019, 3M produces approximately 60,000 products,[69] and has four business groups focused on safety and industrial, transportation and electronics, health care, and consumer products.[70] 3M obtained its first patent in 1924 and acquires approximately 3,000 new patents annually. The company surpassed the 100,000-patent threshold in 2014.[71]\n",
      "3M's Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) program was established in 1975. The program initially focused on pollution reduction at the plant level and was expanded to promote recycling and reduce waste across all divisions in 1989. By the early 1990s, approximately 2,500 3P projects decreased the company's total global pollutant generation by 50 percent and saved 3M $500?600 million by eliminating the production of waste requiring subsequent treatment.[73][74]\n",
      "In 1983, the Oakdale Dump in Oakdale, Minnesota, was listed as an EPA Superfund site after significant groundwater and soil contamination by VOCs and heavy metals was uncovered.[75] The Oakdale Dump was a 3M dumping site utilized through the 1940s and 1950s.\n",
      "During the 1990s and 2000s, 3M reduced releases of toxic pollutants by 99 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by 72 percent. As of 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had awarded 3M with the Energy Star Award each year that it has been presented.[76]\n",
      "In 1999, the EPA began investigating perfluorinated chemicals after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).[77] These materials are part of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances often referred to as PFAS, each of which has different chemical properties.[78] 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS-related product production in May 2000.[79][80] Perfluorinated compounds produced by 3M have been used in non-stick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, and other products.\n",
      "The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFAS from the 1940s to 2002.[81] In response to PFAS contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be \"cleaned through a combination of groundwater pump-out wells and soil sediment excavation.\" The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands.[82] The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing PFAS, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River.[81] The clean-up cost estimate, which included a granular activated carbon system to remove PFAS from the ground water was $50 to $56 million,[83] funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006.[84]\n",
      "In 2008, 3M created the Renewable Energy Division within 3M's Industrial and Transportation Business to focus on Energy Generation and Energy Management.[85][86]\n",
      "In late 2010, the state of Minnesota sued 3M for $5 billion in punitive damages, claiming they released PFCs?classified a toxic chemical by the EPA?into local waterways.[87] A settlement for $850 million was reached in February 2018.[88][80][89] In 2019, 3M, along with the Chemours Company and DuPont, appeared before lawmakers to deny responsibility, with company Senior VP of Corporate Affairs Denise Rutherford arguing that the chemicals pose no human health threats at current levels and that there were no victims.[90]\n",
      "In 2021, research had determined that 3M's Zwijndrecht (Belgium) factory caused PFOS pollution that may be contaminating agricultural products within a 15 kilometer radius of the plant which includes Antwerp.[91][92] The Flemish Government has paid 63 million euros for cleanup costs so far with 3M contributing 75,000 euros.[93] The Flemish Government issued measures advising against the consumption of, for example, home-grown eggs within a radius of 5 kilometers.[94]\n",
      "In 2023, 3M reached an agreement to pay a $10.3bn settlement with numerous US public water systems to resolve thousands of lawsuits over PFAS contamination.[13]\n",
      "3M reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, at 5,280 Kt (-550 /-9.4% y-o-y)[95] and plans to reduce emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.[96] The company also aims achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.[97]\n",
      "The Combat Arms Earplugs, Version 2 (CAEv2), was developed by Aearo Technologies for U.S. military and civilian use. The CAEv2  was a double ended earplug that 3M claimed would offer users different levels of protection.[104] Between 2003 and 2015, these earplugs were standard issue to members of the U.S. military.[105] 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008.[106]\n",
      "In May 2016, Moldex-Metric, Inc., a 3M competitor, filed a whistleblower complaint against 3M under the False Claims Act. Moldex-Metric claimed that 3M made false claims to the U.S. government about the safety of its earplugs and that it knew the earplugs had an inherently defective design.[107] In 2018, 3M agreed to pay $9.1 million to the U.S. government to resolve the allegations, without admitting liability.[108]\n",
      "Since 2018, more than 140,000 former users of the earplugs (primarily U.S. military veterans) have filed suit against 3M claiming they suffer from hearing loss, tinnitus, and other damage as a consequence of the defective design.[109]\n",
      "Internal emails showed that 3M officials boasted about charging $7.63 per piece for the earplugs which cost 85 cents to produce. The company's official response indicated that the cost to the government includes R&D costs.[110]\n",
      "3M settled close to 260,000 lawsuits in August 2023 by agreeing to pay $6 billion to current and former U.S. military members who were affected.[111]\n",
      "The N95 respirator mask was developed by 3M and approved in 1972.[112] Due to its ability to filter viral particulates, its use was recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic but supply soon became short.[112] Much of the company's supply had already been sold prior to the outbreak.[113]\n",
      "The shortages led to the U.S. government asking 3M to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks to Canada and to Latin American countries,[114] and President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to require 3M to prioritize orders from the federal government.[115] The dispute was resolved when 3M agreed to import more respirators, mostly from its factories in China.[115]\n",
      "3M later struck a CA$70M deal with the federal government of Canada and the Ontario provincial government to produce N95 masks at their plant in Brockville, Ontario.[116]\n",
      "3M's general offices, corporate research laboratories, and some division laboratories in the U.S. are in St. Paul, Minnesota.  In the United States, 3M operates 80 manufacturing facilities in 29 states, and 125 manufacturing and converting facilities in 37 countries outside the U.S. (in 2017).[117]\n",
      "During March 2016, 3M completed a 400,000-square-foot (37,000Â m2) research-and-development building on its Maplewood campus that cost $150 million. Seven hundred scientists from various divisions occupy the building.  They were previously scattered across the campus.  3M hopes concentrating its research and development in this manner will improve collaboration.  3M received $9.6 million in local tax increment financing and relief from state sales taxes in order to assist with development of the building.[118]\n",

      "A. O. Smith Corporation is an American manufacturer of both residential and commercial water heaters and boilers, and the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in North America. It also supplies water treatment and water purification products in the Asian market.[6] The company has 27 locations worldwide, including five manufacturing facilities in North America, as well as plants in Bengaluru in India, Nanjing in China and Veldhoven in The Netherlands.[7]\n",
      "In the past, A. O. Smith has had numerous other product lines.  Among them, it was the largest bomb maker in the United States by the end of World War I. Smith ranked 74th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[8]\n",
      "The company today known as the A. O. Smith Corporation was founded in 1874 by Charles Jeremiah Smith as C. J. Smith and Sons, a baby carriage and bicycle parts manufacturer. It began forming steel tubing from sheet metal to make bicycle frames.[9] By 1895, the company was the largest bicycle parts manufacturer. In 1899, Arthur Oliver Smith, a son of the founder, developed the world's first pressed steel vehicle frame and he later began making frames for the Peerless Automobile Company, Cadillac, and Ford Motor Company.[10] In 1904, the company incorporated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as A. O. Smith Company.\n",
      "In 1913, Lloyd Raymond Smith took over, and in 1914, the company introduced the Smith Motor Wheel, a gasoline-powered device for bicycles.\n",
      "In 1915, it began manufacturing the Smith Flyer, which it later sold to Briggs & Stratton of Milwaukee. A year later in 1916, A. O. Smith was incorporated in New York. In 1917, it began manufacturing bomb casings for World War I.\n",
      "In the 1920s, company engineers developed the coated welding rod which they used in manufacturing until 1965, as well as the world's first fully automated automobile frame factory, with the capability of making a frame every eight seconds, until 1958, the first arc-welded, high-pressure vessel used to refine oil, which the company produced until 1963, and oil supply line pipes, until 1972.\n",
      "In 1933, the company used the process of fusing glass to steel to make a large single-piece glass-lined brewery tank. Over the next 32 years, it made more than 11,000 glass-lined tanks. In 1936, the company patented the glass-lined water heater. Three years later, it began mass-producing residential water heaters, but shifted all production to war-time use during World War II.\n",
      "In 1940, the company acquired Sawyer Electric of Los Angeles, California, a manufacturer of electric motors. In 1942, it once again began to produce bomb casings, as well as aircraft propellers, undercarriages, torpedoes, and air flasks. By 1945, the company had built 4.5 million bombs, 16,750 sets of landing gear, and 46,700 propeller blades. It also built nose frames for the B-25 bomber, water heaters, jeep frames, and components for the atomic bomb project. In 1946, it built a 400,000 square foot residential water heater plant in Kankakee, Illinois. From this plant, it also made water heaters with the Kenmore name.[11] In 1948, it entered the commercial water heater market after acquiring The Burkay Company of Toledo, Ohio. In 1949, the company began producing Harvestore, a glass-fused-to-steel silo, targeted at dairy and livestock operations.\n",
      "In the 1950s, A. O. Smith acquired Whirl-A-Way Motors of Dayton, Ohio, and consolidated its electric motor manufacturing operations there. The motor division later introduced the hermetic motor, a critical component of air conditioning and refrigeration compressors. Its water heater division introduced the first glass-lined commercial water heater, the A. O. Smith Burkay B-65, and later the company established a glass fiber division to replace steel in many applications.

A Fortune Global 500 company, it reported revenues of $64.9 billion in 2024.[3]\n",

      "In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide SociÃ©tÃ© CoopÃ©rative (AWSC). Throughout the 1990s, tensions grew between the two units. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit ? whether AA or AC, pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting. This dispute came to a head in 1998, when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In 2000, as a result of arbitration, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen.

Critics such as former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[31] reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda was a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[32] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that \"prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity.\"[33]\n",

      "Adobe Inc. (/??do?bi/ ?-DOH-bee), formerly Adobe Systems Incorporated, is an American computer software company based in San Jose, California. It offers a wide range of programs from web design tools, photo manipulation and vector creation, through to video/audio editing, mobile app development, print layout and animation software. It has historically specialized in software for the creation and publication of a wide range of content, including graphics, photography, illustration, animation, multimedia/video, motion pictures, and print. Its flagship products include Adobe Photoshop image editing software; Adobe Illustrator vector-based illustration software; Adobe Acrobat Reader and the Portable Document Format (PDF); and a host of tools primarily for audio-visual content creation, editing and publishing. Adobe offered a bundled solution of its products named Adobe Creative Suite, which evolved into a subscription software as a service (SaaS) offering named Adobe Creative Cloud.[2] The company also expanded into digital marketing software and in 2021 was considered one of the top global leaders in Customer Experience Management (CXM).[3]\n",
      "Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5] Adobe later developed animation and multimedia through its acquisition of Macromedia, from which it acquired Macromedia Flash; video editing and compositing software with Adobe Premiere, later known as Adobe Premiere Pro; low-code web development with Adobe Muse; and a suite of software for digital marketing management.\n",
      "As of 2022,[update] Adobe has more than 26,000 employees worldwide.[4] Adobe also has major development operations in the United States in Newton,[6] New York City, Arden Hills, Lehi, Seattle, Austin and San Francisco. It also has major development operations in Noida and Bangalore in India.[7] The company has long been the dominant tech firm in design and creative software,[8][9] despite attracting criticism for its policies and practices particularly around Adobe Creative Cloud's switch to subscription only pricing and its early termination fees for its most promoted Creative Cloud plan, the latter of which attracted a joint civil lawsuit from the US Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice in 2024.[10]\n",
      "The company was started in John Warnock's garage.[11] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, a stream which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] That creek is named because of the type of clay found there (Adobe being a Spanish word for Mudbrick). Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized \"A\" and was designed by graphic designer Marva Warnock, John Warnock's wife.[12] Steve Jobs attempted to buy the company for $5 million[13] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company. Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[14]\n",
      "Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[15]\n",
      "PostScript was the first international standard for computer printing as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[16] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of PostScript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[17] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[15]\n",
      "Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1, worked on by Bill Paxton after he left Stanford. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.\n",
      "Starting in the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market, starting with Adobe Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew out of the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers. By the mid-1990s, Adobe would either develop or acquire Photoshop from John and Thomas Knoll, FrameMaker from Frame Technology Corporation, and After Effects and PageMaker from Aldus, as well as develop Adobe Premiere, later known as Premiere Pro, in-house, initially releasing it in 1991.[18][19][20] Around the same time as the development of Illustrator, Adobe entered the NASDAQ Composite index in August 1986.[21][22]\n",
      "In 1993, Adobe introduced the Portable Document Format, commonly shortened to the initialism PDF, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. Warnock originally developed the PDF under a code name, \"The Camelot Project\", using PostScript technology to create a widely available digital document format, able to display text, raster graphics, vector graphics, and fonts. Adobe kept the PDF as a proprietary file format from its introduction until 2008, when the PDF became an ISO international standard under ISO number ISO 32000-1:2008, though the PDF file format was free for viewers since its introduction.[23][24]\n",

      "The 2000s saw various developments for the company. Its first notable acquisition in the decade was in 2002, when Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio, also known as JetForm.[26] In May 2003, Adobe purchased audio editing and multitrack recording software Cool Edit Pro from Syntrillium Software for $16.5Â million,[27] as well as a large loop library called \"Loopology\". Adobe then renamed Cool Edit Pro to Adobe Audition.\n",
      "It was in 2003 that the company introduced the first version of Adobe Creative Suite, bundling its creative software into a single package. The first version of Creative Suite introduced InDesign (the successor to PageMaker), Illustrator, Photoshop, ImageReady and InCopy, with the 2005 second edition of Creative Suite including an updated version of Adobe Acrobat, Premiere Pro, GoLive, the file manager Adobe Bridge, and Adobe Dreamweaver, the latter of which was acquired from a $3.4 billion acquisition of Macromedia, most notably .[28][29]\n",

      "By April 2008, Adobe released Adobe Media Player.[31] On April 27, Adobe discontinued the development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive, in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[32] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium, and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about US$1,700 to $2,500[33] or by individual application.[34] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[34] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.\n",
      "On September 15, 2009, Adobe Systems announced that it would acquire online marketing and web analytics company Omniture for $1.8Â billion.[35] The deal was completed on October 23, 2009.[36] Former Omniture products were integrated into the Adobe Marketing Cloud.[37]\n",

      "A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley?based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[56] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached an agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5Â million to settle the suit.[citation needed]\n",
      "2011 saw the company first introduce Adobe Creative Cloud, a $600/year subscription plan to its creative software as opposed to a one-time perpetual license payment which could often top $2000 for creative professionals. The initial launch of Creative Cloud alongside Creative Suite 5 users came at the same time that Adobe ran into controversy from users of Adobe's creative software, with users of Adobe software stating that the original perpetual and subscription pricing plans for CS5 would be unaffordable for not only individuals but also businesses, as well as refusing to extend a Creative Suite 6 discount to non-CS5 users. The original announcement of Adobe Creative Cloud was met with a positive reception from CNET journalists as a much more enticing plan, and Creative Cloud was first released in 2012, though a later CNET survey evidenced that more users had a negative perception about subscription creative software than a positive view. The original pricing plan for Creative Cloud was $75 per month for the entire suite of software, though Adobe discounted the monthly cost to $50 for users willing to commit to at least one year of continuous subscription for Creative Cloud, and down to $30 per month for former CS users with the one year commitment.[57][58]\n",
      "By 2013, Adobe decided that CS6 would be the last version of Creative Suite software that would be sold through perpetual licensing option, and in May announced that a Creative Cloud subscription would be the only way to get the newest versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Adobe creative software. Reception to the mandatory subscriptions for future Adobe software was mostly negative, despite some positive testimonies on the move from customers and Adobe's attraction of 500,000 Creative Cloud subscribers by the service's first year.[59] The switch to subscription only also did not deter software piracy of Creative Cloud services; within the first day of the first version of Photoshop exclusively made for Creative Cloud being released, cracked versions of Adobe Photoshop CC 2013 were found on The Pirate Bay, an online website used for distributing pirated software.[60][61]\n",
      "In March 2018, at Adobe Summit, the company and Nvidia announced their association to upgrade their AI and profound learning innovations.

      "Adobe announced a $20 billion acquisition of Figma, an Adobe XD competitor, in September 2022,[73] its largest to date.[74] Regulatory scrutiny from the US and European Union began shortly after due to concerns that Adobe, already a major player in the design software market with XD, would have too much control if it also owned Figma. At the time of the announcement to acquire Figma, Adobe's share over the creative software market and design-software market was almost a monopoly.[75] In December 2023, the two companies called off their merger, citing the regulatory challenges as a sign to both that the deal was not likely to be approved. Adobe paid Figma a $1 billion termination fee per their merger agreement.[76][77][78][79][80]\n",

Many also showed their cancellation fees for Adobe Creative Cloud, with this leading to many encouraging piracy of Adobe products and/or purchase of alternatives with lower prices or using free and open-source software instead. Furthermore, there have been reports that with changing subscriptions it is possible to avoid paying this fee.[143][144]\n",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice and the FTC filed a lawsuit against Adobe and two of its executives in June 2024, alleging that the company's deceptive subscription practices and cancellation policies violated the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act. According to the lawsuit, the company purportedly used small text disclosures, optional input fields, and complex web of links to obscure a concealed early termination fee. This fee reportedly amounted to fifty percent of the remaining value of annual contracts for users who chose to cancel early in the first year, resulting in significant penalties. Customers who tried to cancel services by contacting customer service faced obstacles, including dropped calls and multiple transfers between representatives; others continued to be billed by Adobe, under the mistaken belief that they had successfully ended their subscriptions.[10][145][146][147]\n",

The company has also expanded into new markets, such as the data center, gaming, and high-performance computing[2] markets. AMD's processors are used in a wide range of computing devices, including personal computers, servers, laptops, and gaming consoles. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009. Through its Xilinx acquisition in 2022, AMD offers field-programmable gate array (FPGA) products.\n",
      "AMD was founded in 1969 by Jerry Sanders and a group of other technology professionals. The company's early products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers. In 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market, competing with Intel, its main rival in the industry. In the early 2000s, it experienced significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of its Athlon and Opteron processors. However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors.\n",
      "In the late 2010s, AMD regained market share by pursuing a penetration pricing strategy[3] and building on the success of its Ryzen processors, which were considerably more competitive with Intel microprocessors in terms of performance while offering attractive pricing.[4]\n",
      "Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated by Jerry Sanders, along with seven of his colleagues from Fairchild Semiconductor, on May 1, 1969.[5][6] Sanders, an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at Fairchild, had, like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within the company. He later decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company,[7] following the footsteps of Robert Noyce (developer of the first silicon integrated circuit at Fairchild in 1959)[8] and Gordon Moore, who together founded the semiconductor company Intel in July 1968.[9]\n",
      "In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location in Santa Clara to Sunnyvale, California.[10] To immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by Fairchild and National Semiconductor.[11][12] AMD first focused on producing logic chips.[13] The company guaranteed quality control to United States Military Standard, an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers ? including computer manufacturers, the telecommunications industry, and instrument manufacturers ? wanted to avoid.[11][14][15][16]\n",
      "In November 1969, the company manufactured its first product: the Am9300, a 4-bit MSI shift register, which began selling in 1970.[16][17] Also in 1970, AMD produced its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter, which was highly successful.[18][19] Its bestselling product in 1971 was the Am2505, the fastest multiplier available.[18][20]\n",
      "In 1971, AMD entered the RAM chip market, beginning with the Am3101, a 64-bit bipolar RAM.[20][21] That year AMD also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits, and by year-end the company's total annual sales reached US$4.6Â million.[18][22]\n",
      "AMD went public in September 1972.[11][23][24] The company was a second source for Intel MOS/LSI circuits by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers.[25][26] By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products ? of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a static N-channel 1024-bit RAM)[27] and three low-power Schottky MSI circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.[28]\n",
      "Intel had created the first microprocessor, its 4-bit 4004, in 1971.[29][30] By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with the Am9080, a reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080,[31][32][33] and the Am2900 bit-slice microprocessor family.[32] When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a cross-licensing agreement with AMD, which was granted a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.[28][34][35][36][37]\n",
      "In 1977, AMD entered into a joint venture with Siemens, a German engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the American market.[38] Siemens purchased 20% of AMD's stock, giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines.[38][39][40] The two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers (AMC), located in Silicon Valley and in Germany, allowing AMD to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field,[38][41][42][43] in particular based on AMD's second-source Zilog Z8000 microprocessors.[44][45] When the two companies' vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged, AMD bought out Siemens' stake in the American division in 1979.[46][47] AMD closed Advanced Micro Computers in late 1981 after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors.[44][48][49]\n",

      "Intel had introduced the first x86 microprocessors in 1978.[53] In 1981, IBM created its PC, and wanted Intel's x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel would also provide a second-source manufacturer for its patented x86 microprocessors.[14] Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first signed in October 1981[48][54] and formally executed in February 1982.[37] The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other; that is, each party could \"earn\" the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company.[36] The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMD?Intel cross-licensing agreement through 1995.[36][37] The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice.[36] The main result of the 1982 agreement was that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its 8086, 80186, and 80286 chips.[37] However, in the event of a bankruptcy or takeover of AMD, the cross-licensing agreement would be effectively canceled.[55]\n",
      "Beginning in 1982, AMD began volume-producing second-source Intel-licensed 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, and by 1984, its own Am286 clone of Intel's 80286 processor, for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs and IBM clones.[14][56] It also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips.[57]\n",
      "The company continued to spend greatly on research and development,[58] and created the world's first 512K EPROM in 1984.[59] That year, AMD was listed in the book The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America,[51][60] and later made the Fortune 500 list for the first time in 1985.[61][62]\n",
      "By mid-1985, the microchip market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices (dumping) from Japan, but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the United States.[63] AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing,[64] devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chipset per week for 52 weeks in fiscal year 1986,[51][65] and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing.[66] During this time, AMD withdrew from the DRAM market,[67] and made some headway into the CMOS market, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.[68]\n",
      "AMD had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 \"World Chip\" FSK modem, one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex.[69] Beginning in 1986, AMD embraced the perceived shift toward RISC with their own AMD Am29000 (29k) processor;[70] the 29k survived as an embedded processor.[71][72] The company also increased its EPROM memory market share in the late 1980s.[73] Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its 386-compatible Am386, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.[74]\n",
      "AMD had a large, successful flash memory business, even during the dotcom bust.[75] In 2003, to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow, which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel, AMD spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into Spansion, a joint venture with Fujitsu, which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with AMD since 1993.[76][77] In December 2005, AMD divested itself of Spansion to focus on the microprocessor market, and Spansion went public in an IPO.[78]\n",
      "On July 24, 2006, AMD announced its acquisition of the Canadian 3D graphics card company ATI Technologies. AMD paid $4.3Â billion and 58Â million shares of its capital stock, for approximately $5.4Â billion. The transaction was completed on October 25, 2006.[79] On August 30, 2010, AMD announced that it would retire the ATI brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD brand name.[80][81]\n",
      "In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of GlobalFoundries Inc., a multibillion-dollar joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co., an investment company formed by the government of Abu Dhabi. The partnership and spin-off gave AMD an infusion of cash and allowed it to focus solely on chip design.[82] To assure the Abu Dhabi investors of the new venture's success, AMD's CEO Hector Ruiz stepped down in July 2008, while remaining executive chairman, in preparation for becoming chairman of GlobalFoundries in March 2009.[83][84] President and COO Dirk Meyer became AMD's CEO.[85] Recessionary losses necessitated AMD cutting 1,100 jobs in 2009.[86]\n",
      "In August 2011, AMD announced that former Lenovo executive Rory Read would be joining the company as CEO, replacing Meyer.[87] In November 2011, AMD announced plans to lay off more than 10% (1,400) of its employees from across all divisions worldwide.[88] In October 2012, it announced plans to lay off an additional 15% of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue.[89] The inclusion of AMD chips into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were later seen as saving AMD from bankruptcy.[90][91]\n",
      "AMD acquired the low-power server manufacturer SeaMicro in early 2012, with an eye to bringing out an Arm64 server chip.[92]\n",
      "On October 8, 2014, AMD announced that Rory Read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer.[93] He was succeeded by Lisa Su, a key lieutenant who had been chief operating officer since June.[94]\n",
      "On October 16, 2014, AMD announced a new restructuring plan along with its Q3 results. Effective July 1, 2014, AMD reorganized into two business groups: Computing and Graphics, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. As part of this restructuring, AMD announced that 7% of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of 2014.[95]\n",
      "After the GlobalFoundries spin-off and subsequent layoffs, AMD was left with significant vacant space at 1 AMD Place, its aging Sunnyvale headquarters office complex. In August 2016, AMD's 47 years in Sunnyvale came to a close when it signed a lease with the Irvine Company for a new 220,000 sq. ft. headquarters building in Santa Clara.[96] AMD's new location at Santa Clara Square faces the headquarters of archrival Intel across the Bayshore Freeway and San Tomas Aquino Creek. Around the same time, AMD also agreed to sell 1 AMD Place to the Irvine Company.[97] In April 2019, the Irvine Company secured approval from the Sunnyvale City Council of its plans to demolish 1 AMD Place and redevelop the entire 32-acre site into townhomes and apartments.[97]\n",
      "In October 2020, AMD announced that it was acquiring Xilinx, one of the market leaders in field programmable gate arrays and complex programmable logic devices (FPGAs and CPLDs) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was completed in February 2022, with an estimated acquisition price of $50Â billion.[98][99]\n",
      "In October 2023, AMD acquired an open-source AI software provider, Nod.ai, to bolster its AI software ecosystem.[100][101]\n",
      "In January 2024, AMD announced it was discontinuing the production of all complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) acquired through Xilinx.[102]\n",
      "In March 2024, a rally in semiconductor stocks pushed AMD's valuation above $300B for the first time.[103]\n",
      "In July 2024 AMD announced that it would acquire the Finnish-based artificial intelligence startup company Silo AI in a $665 million all-cash deal in an attempt to better compete with AI chip market leader Nvidia.[104]\n",
      "In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with Intel, becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of 8086 and 8088 processors. IBM wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its IBM PC, but its policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the Am286 under the same arrangement. In 1984, Intel internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying product information to shore up its advantage in the marketplace, and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the Intel 80386.[105] In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue, and Intel reacted by canceling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether.[106][107] After three years of testimony, AMD eventually won in arbitration in 1992, but Intel disputed this decision. Another long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the Supreme Court of California sided with the arbitrator and AMD.[108][109]\n",
      "In 1990, Intel countersued AMD, renegotiating AMD's right to use derivatives of Intel's microcode for its cloned processors.[110] In the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute, AMD was forced to develop clean room designed versions of Intel code for its x386 and x486 processors, the former long after Intel had released its own x386 in 1985.[111] In March 1991, AMD released the Am386, its clone of the Intel 386 processor.[51] By October of the same year it had sold one million units.[51]\n",
      "In 1993, AMD introduced the first of the Am486 family of processors,[19] which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers, including Compaq, which signed an exclusive agreement using the Am486.[11][112][113] The Am5x86, another Am486-based processor, was released in November 1995, and continued AMD's success as a fast, cost-effective processor.[114][115]\n",
      "Finally, in an agreement effective 1996, AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors.[116][117]\n",
      "AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the K5, launched in 1996.[118] The \"K\" in its name was a reference to Kryptonite, the only substance known to harm comic book character Superman. This itself was a reference to Intel's hegemony over the market, i.e., an anthropomorphization of them as Superman.[119] The number \"5\" was a reference to the fifth generation of x86 processors; rival Intel had previously introduced its line of fifth-generation x86 processors as Pentium because the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.[120]\n",
      "In 1996, AMD purchased NexGen, specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the K6 processor, introduced in 1997. Although it was based on Socket 7, variants such as K6-III/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth-generation processor).\n",
      "The K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut under the brand name Athlon on June 23, 1999. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's Slot 1 connector, and instead used a Slot A connector, referenced to the Alpha processor bus. The Duron was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64Â KB instead of 256Â KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. Sempron was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the socket A PGA era. It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets, up to AM3.\n",
      "On October 9, 2001, the Athlon XP was released. On February 10, 2003, the Athlon XP with 512Â KB L2 Cache was released.[121]\n",
      "The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a 64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set (called x86-64, AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high-performance point-to-point interconnect called HyperTransport, as part of the Direct Connect Architecture. The technology was initially launched as the Opteron server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003.[122] Shortly thereafter, it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded Athlon 64.[123]\n",
      "On April 21, 2005, AMD released the first dual-core Opteron, an x86-based server CPU.[124] A month later, it released the Athlon 64 X2, the first desktop-based dual-core processor family.[125] In May 2007, AMD abandoned the string \"64\" in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of 64-bit computing in its processors. Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of the target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.\n",
      "In September 2007, AMD released the first server Opteron K10 processors,[126] followed in November by the Phenom processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, triple-core,[127] and quad-core versions, with all cores on a single die. AMD released a new platform codenamed \"Spider\", which used the new Phenom processor, as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series.[128] However, AMD built the Spider at 65nm, which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient 45nm.\n",
      "In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed Phenom II, a refresh of the original Phenom built using the 45Â nm process.[129] AMD's new platform, codenamed \"Dragon\", used the new Phenom II processor, and an ATI R770 GPU from the R700 GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series.[130] The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache, and a Cool'n'Quiet bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range Core 2 Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor's memory controller, allowing it to use DDR3 in a new native socket AM3, while maintaining backward compatibility with AM2+, the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the DDR2 memory that was used with the platform.\n",
      "In April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II Hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed \"Thuban\".[131] This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core \"Istanbul\" Opteron processor. It included AMD's \"turbo core\" technology, which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed.\n",
      "The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts were released in 2010.[132] The Magny Cours part came in 8 to 12Â cores and the Lisbon part in 4 and 6Â core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM (multi-chip module) with two hexa-core \"Istanbul\" Opteron parts. This will use a new socket G34 for dual and quad-socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses socket C32 certified for dual-socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45 nm SOI process.\n",
      "Following AMD's 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies, an initiative codenamed Fusion was announced to integrate a CPU and GPU together on some of AMD's microprocessors, including a built in PCI Express link to accommodate separate PCI Express peripherals, eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard. The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. floating-point unit operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed the AMD APU (Accelerated Processing Unit).[133]\n",
      "Llano was AMD's first APU built for laptops. Llano was the second APU released,[134] targeted at the mainstream market.[133] It incorporated a CPU and GPU on the same die, as well as northbridge functions, and used \"Socket FM1\" with DDR3 memory. The CPU part of the processor was based on the Phenom II \"Deneb\" processor. AMD suffered an unexpected decrease in revenue based on production problems for the Llano.[135] More AMD APUs for laptops running Windows 7 and Windows 8 OS are being used commonly. These include AMD's price-point APUs, the E1 and E2, and their mainstream competitors with Intel's Core i-series: The Vision A- series, the A standing for accelerated. These range from the lower-performance A4 chipset to the A6, A8, and A10. These all incorporate next-generation Radeon graphics cards, with the A4 utilizing the base Radeon HD chip and the rest using a Radeon R4 graphics card, with the exception of the highest-model A10 (A10-7300) which uses an R6 graphics card.\n",
      "Bulldozer was AMD's microarchitecture codename for server and desktop AMD FX processors, first released on October 12, 2011. This family 15h microarchitecture is the successor to the family 10h (K10) microarchitecture design. Bulldozer was a clean-sheet design, not a development of earlier processors.[136] The core was specifically aimed at 10?125Â W TDP computing products. AMD claimed dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance-competitive with Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K10 models they were built to replace.[137][138][139]\n",
      "The Piledriver microarchitecture was the 2012 successor to Bulldozer, increasing clock speeds and performance relative to its predecessor.[140] Piledriver would be released in AMD FX, APU, and Opteron product lines.[141][142][143][144] Piledriver was subsequently followed by the Steamroller microarchitecture in 2013. Used exclusively in AMD's APUs, Steamroller focused on greater parallelism.[145][146]\n",
      "In 2015, the Excavator microarchitecture replaced Piledriver.[147] Expected to be the last microarchitecture of the Bulldozer series,[148][149] Excavator focused on improved power efficiency.[150]\n",
      "The Bobcat microarchitecture was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice-president Henri Richard in Computex 2007 and was put into production during the first quarter of 2011.[134] Based on the difficulty competing in the x86 market with a single core optimized for the 10?100Â W range, AMD had developed a simpler core with a target range of 1?10Â watts.[151] In addition, it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1Â W.[152]\n",
      "Jaguar is a microarchitecture codename for Bobcat's successor, released in 2013, that is used in various APUs from AMD aimed at the low-power/low-cost market.[153] Jaguar and its derivates would go on to be used in the custom APUs of the PlayStation 4,[154][155] Xbox One,[156][157] PlayStation 4 Pro,[158][159][160] Xbox One S,[161] and Xbox One X.[162][163] Jaguar would be later followed by the Puma microarchitecture in 2014.[164]\n",
      "In 2012, AMD announced it was working on ARM products, both as a semi-custom product and server product.[165][166][167] The initial server product was announced as the Opteron A1100 in 2014, an 8-core Cortex-A57-based ARMv8-A SoC,[168][169] and was expected to be followed by an APU incorporating a Graphics Core Next GPU.[170] However, the Opteron A1100 was not released until 2016, with the delay attributed to adding software support.[171] The A1100 was also criticized for not having support from major vendors upon its release.[171][172][173]\n",
      "In 2014, AMD also announced the K12 custom core for release in 2016.[174] While being ARMv8-A instruction set architecture compliant, the K12 was expected to be entirely custom-designed, targeting the server, embedded, and semi-custom markets. While ARM architecture development continued, products based on K12 were subsequently delayed with no release planned. Development of AMD's x86-based Zen microarchitecture was preferred.[175][176]\n",
      "Zen is an architecture for x86-64 based Ryzen series of CPUs and APUs, introduced in 2017 by AMD and built from the ground up by a team led by Jim Keller, beginning with his arrival in 2012, and taping out before his departure in September 2015.\n",
      "One of AMD's primary goals with Zen was an IPC increase of at least 40%, however in February 2017 AMD announced that they had actually achieved a 52% increase.[177] Processors made on the Zen architecture are built on the 14Â nm FinFET node and have a renewed focus on single-core performance and HSA compatibility.[178] Previous processors from AMD were either built in the 32Â nm process (\"Bulldozer\" and \"Piledriver\" CPUs) or the 28Â nm process (\"Steamroller\" and \"Excavator\" APUs). Because of this, Zen is much more energy efficient.\n",
      "The Zen architecture is the first to encompass CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a single socket (Socket AM4). Also new for this architecture is the implementation of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology, something Intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary hyper-threading implementation of SMT. This is a departure from the \"Clustered MultiThreading\" design introduced with the Bulldozer architecture. Zen also has support for DDR4 memory.\n",
      "AMD released the Zen-based high-end Ryzen 7 \"Summit Ridge\" series CPUs on March 2, 2017,[179] mid-range Ryzen 5 series CPUs on April 11, 2017, and entry level Ryzen 3 series CPUs on July 27, 2017.[180] AMD later released the Epyc line of Zen derived server processors for 1P and 2P systems.[181] In October 2017, AMD released Zen-based APUs as Ryzen Mobile, incorporating Vega graphics cores.[182] In January 2018 AMD has announced their new lineup plans, with Ryzen 2.[183] AMD launched CPUs with the 12nm Zen+[184] microarchitecture in April 2018, following up with the 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture in June 2019, including an update to the Epyc line with new processors using the ZenÂ 2 microarchitecture in August 2019, and Zen 3 slated for release in Q3 2020.\n",
      "As of 2019, AMD's Ryzen processors were reported to outsell Intel's consumer desktop processors.[185] At CES 2020 AMD announced their Ryzen Mobile 4000, as the first 7Â nm x86 mobile processor,[vague] the first 7Â nm 8-core (also 16-thread) high-performance mobile processor, and the first 8-core (also 16-thread) processor for ultrathin laptops.[186] This generation is still based on the ZenÂ 2 architecture. In October 2020, AMD announced new processors based on the Zen 3 architecture.[187] On PassMark's Single thread performance test the Ryzen 5 5600x bested all other CPUs besides the Ryzen 9 5950X.[188]\n",
      "In April 2020, AMD launched three new SKUs which target commercial HPC workloads & hyperconverged infrastructure applications. The launch was based on Epyc?s 7Â nm second-generation Rome platform and supported by Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, and Nutanix. IBM Cloud was its first public cloud partner.[189] In August 2022, AMD announced their initial lineup of CPUs based on the new Zen 4 architecture.[190]\n",
      "The Steam Deck,[191][192] PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S all use chips based on the ZenÂ 2 microarchitecture, with proprietary tweaks and different configurations in each system's implementation than AMD sells in its own commercially available APUs.[193][194]\n",
      "Lee Ka Lau,[195] Francis Lau, Benny Lau, and Kwok Yuen Ho[196] founded ATI in 1985 as Array Technology Inc.[197]\n",
      "Working primarily in the OEM field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as IBM and Commodore. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder card product lines that year.[198] In the early nineties, they released products able to process graphics without the CPU: in May 1991, the Mach8, in 1992 the Mach32, which offered improved memory bandwidth and GUI acceleration. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993, with shares listed on NASDAQ and on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n",
      "In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for YUV-to-RGB colour space conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration.\n",
      "ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and 3D accelerator under the name 3D Rage. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the Rage Pro was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to 3dfx's 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced DirectX 6.0 accelerator in 1999 Rage 128.\n",
      "The All-in-Wonder product line, introduced in 1996, was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with TV tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a TV set.[199] The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analogue video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception.\n",
      "ATI entered the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to laptops in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from those of desktop PCs, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, TMDS output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired Tseng Labs's graphics assets, which included 40 engineers.\n",
      "The Radeon line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon graphics processing unit offered an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions.\n",
      "In 2000, ATI acquired ArtX, which engineered the Flipper graphics chip used in the GameCube video game console. They also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed Hollywood) for the successor of the GameCube, the Wii. Microsoft contracted ATI to design the graphics core (codenamed Xenos) for the Xbox 360. Later in 2005, ATI acquired Terayon's cable modem silicon intellectual property, strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market.[200] K. Y. Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November 2005. Dave Orton replaced him as the President and CEO of the organization.\n",
      "On July 24, 2006, a joint announcement revealed that AMD would acquire ATI in a deal valued at $5.6 billion.[201] The acquisition consideration closed on October 25, 2006,[202] and included over $2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of AMD stock.[203] ATI's operations became part of the AMD Graphics Product Group (GPG),[204] and ATI's CEO Dave Orton became the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses at AMD until his resignation in 2007.[205] The top-level management was reorganized with the Senior Vice President and General Manager, and the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group, both of whom would report to the CEO of AMD.[206] On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD would retire the ATI brand for its graphics chipsets in favour of the AMD name.[207]\n",
      "In 2008, the ATI division of AMD released the TeraScale microarchitecture implementing a unified shader model. This design replaced the previous fixed-function hardware of previous graphics cards with multipurpose, programmable shaders. Initially released as part of the GPU for the Xbox 360, this technology would go on to be used in Radeon branded HD 2000 parts. Three generations of TeraScale would be designed and used in parts from 2008 to 2014.\n",
      "In a 2009 restructuring, AMD merged the CPU and GPU divisions to support the company's APUs, which fused both graphics and general purpose processing.[208][209] In 2011, AMD released the successor to TeraScale, Graphics Core Next (GCN).[210] This new microarchitecture emphasized GPGPU compute capability in addition to graphics processing, with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on AMD's APUs. GCN's reduced instruction set ISA allowed for significantly increased compute capability over TeraScale's very long instruction word ISA. Since GCN's introduction with the HD 7970, five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from 2008 through at least 2017.[211]\n",
      "In September 2015, AMD separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the Radeon Technologies Group (RTG) headed by Raja Koduri.[212] This gave the graphics division of AMD autonomy in product design and marketing.[213][214] The RTG then went on to create and release the Polaris and Vega microarchitectures released in 2016 and 2017, respectively.[215][216] In particular the Vega, or fifth-generation GCN, microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities.[217][218]\n",
      "In November 2017, Raja Koduri left RTG[219] and CEO and President Lisa Su took his position. In January 2018, it was reported that two industry veterans joined RTG, namely Mike Rayfield as senior vice president and general manager of RTG, and David Wang as senior vice president of engineering for RTG.[220] In January 2020, AMD announced that its second-generation RDNA graphics architecture was in development, with the aim of competing with the Nvidia RTX graphics products for performance leadership. In October 2020, AMD announced their new RX 6000 series[221] series GPUs, their first high-end product based on RDNA2 and capable of handling ray-tracing natively, aiming to challenge Nvidia's RTX 3000 GPUs.\n",
      "In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began a program to offer semi-custom designs.[222][223] Rather than AMD simply designing and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5.[224][225][226][160][163][227] Financially, these semi-custom products would represent a majority of the company's revenue in 2016.[228][229] In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and HBM2 memory.[230]\n",
      "Before the launch of Athlon 64 processors in 2003, AMD designed chipsets for their processors spanning the K6 and K7 processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751, and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of Athlon 64 processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the \"Open Platform Management Architecture\" with ATI, VIA and SiS developing their own chipset for Athlon 64 processors and later Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon 64 FX processors, including the Quad FX platform chipset from Nvidia.\n",
      "The initiative went further with the release of Opteron server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today,[when?] Nvidia and Broadcom are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.\n",
      "As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the Radeon Xpress 200 and the Radeon Xpress 3200 chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as AMD 580X CrossFire chipset). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD 690G chipset (previously under the development codename RS690), targeted at mainstream IGP computing. It was the industry's first to implement a HDMI 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of Radeon Xpress 1250 (codenamed RS600, sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of 1333 MHz FSB to ATI.\n",
      "On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the AMD 7-Series chipsets, covering from the enthusiast multi-graphics segment to the value IGP segment, to replace the AMD 480/570/580 chipsets and AMD 690 series chipsets, marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset. Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007, as part of the codenamed Spider desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring 2008 as part of the codenamed Cartwheel platform.\n",
      "AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the AMD 800S series server chipsets. It includes support for up to six SATA 6.0 Gbit/s ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in Fusion processors and AHCI 1.2 with SATA FIS-based switching support. This is a chipset family supporting Phenom processors and Quad FX enthusiast platform (890FX), IGP (890GX).\n",
      "With the advent of AMD's APUs in 2011, traditional northbridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to a single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided southbridge functionality.[231]\n",
      "AMD released new chipsets in 2017 to support the release of their new Ryzen products. As the Zen microarchitecture already includes much of the northbridge connectivity, the AM4-based chipsets primarily varied in the number of additional PCI Express lanes, USB connections, and SATA connections available.[232] These AM4 chipsets were designed in conjunction with ASMedia.[233]\n",
      "In the early 1990s, AMD began marketing a series of embedded system-on-a-chips (SoCs) called AMD Ãlan, starting with the SC300 and SC310. Both combines a 32-Bit, Am386SX, low-voltage 25Â MHz or 33Â MHz CPU with memory controller, PC/AT peripheral controllers, real-time clock, PLL clock generators and ISA bus interface. The SC300 integrates in addition two PC card slots and a CGA-compatible LCD controller. They were followed in 1996 by the SC4xx types. Now supporting VESA Local Bus and using the Am486 with up to 100Â MHz clock speed. A SC450 with 33Â MHze.g. was used in the Nokia 9000 Communicator. In 1999 the SC520 was announced. Using an Am586 with 100Â MHz or 133Â MHz and supporting SDRAM and PCI it was the latest member of the series.[234][235]\n",

      "In August 2003, AMD also purchased the Geode business which was originally the Cyrix MediaGX from National Semiconductor to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products.[238] During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors 667 MHz and 1 GHz, and 1.4Â GHz processor with fan, of TDP 25Â W. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several UMPC designs in Asia markets, as well as the OLPC XO-1 computer, an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world.[239] The Geode LX processor was announced in 2005 and is said will continue to be available through 2015.[needs update]\n",
      "AMD has also introduced 64-bit processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD Opteron processor. Leveraging the high throughput enabled through HyperTransport and the Direct Connect Architecture these server-class processors have been targeted at high-end telecom and storage applications. In 2007, AMD added the AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same 64-bit instruction set and Direct Connect Architecture as the AMD Opteron but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008, AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and dual-core AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded 64-bit solutions starting with 8Â W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.[240]\n",

      "In 2008, AMD spun off its chip foundries into an independent company named GlobalFoundries.[277] This breakup of the company was attributed to the increasing costs of each process node. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), purchasing the final stake from AMD in 2009.[278]\n",
      "With the spin-off of its foundries, AMD became a fabless semiconductor manufacturer, designing products to be produced at for-hire foundries. Part of the GlobalFoundries spin-off included an agreement with AMD to produce some number of products at GlobalFoundries.[279] Both prior to the spin-off and after AMD has pursued production with other foundries including TSMC and Samsung.[280][281] It has been argued that this would reduce risk for AMD by decreasing dependence on any one foundry which has caused issues in the past.[281][282]\n",

      "Agilent Technologies, Inc. is an American global company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, that provides instruments, software, services, and consumables for laboratories. Agilent was established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[2][3] From 1999 to 2014, the company produced optics (LED, laser), semiconductors, EDA software and test and measurement equipment for electronics; that division was spun off to form Keysight.[4] Since then, the company has continued to expand into pharmaceutical, diagnostics & clinical, and academia & government (research) markets.[5]\n",
      "Agilent serves analytical laboratories and the clinical and routine diagnostics markets with a full suite of technology platforms. These include: automation, bioreagents, FISH probes, gas and liquid chromatography, immunohistochemistry, informatics, mass spectrometry, microarrays, spectroscopy, target enrichment, and vacuum technologies.[6]\n",
      "Agilent also provides lab management services, including enterprise asset management, laboratory business intelligence, equipment management and service, software maintenance, regulatory compliance, sample preparation, genomics and cloning, GC and HPLC columns, spectrometry and spectroscopy supplies, and consumables.[6] The company is known for investing in R&D within its own research labs and those of leading universities to advance the state of knowledge in the life sciences, diagnostics, and chemical analysis space.[7]\n",
      "In recent years, the company has advanced digital lab instrumentation and technology that improves lab workflow and overall efficiency and productivity. In 2020, Agilent introduced CrossLab Virtual Assist, a mobile app that facilities high-quality remote technical support.[8] Agilent?s digital advancements, including CrossLab Connect, have also improved lab optimization and sustainability by providing more efficient utilization of instruments, which can lower a lab?s energy consumption.[9]\n",
      "Agilent is also a pioneer of the target enrichment used as part of a NGS workflow. The portfolio also includes sample prep, QA/QC instrumentation, 2100 bioanalyzers, and automation tools. [10]\n",
      "In early 2023, the company announced a $725 million expansion of its nucleic acid-based therapeutics manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado.[11]\n",
      "Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 as a spin-off of several business units of Hewlett-Packard[12] including test & measurement, optics, instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic components, and medical equipment product lines.[13][note 1]  The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[14]  The company's launch slogan was \"Innovating the HP Way\", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[14]  The starburst logo was selected to reflect \"a burst of insight\" (or \"spark of insight\")[15] and the name \"Agilent\" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[14]  The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised $2.1 billion, setting a record at the time.[2]\n",
      "In the early 2000s, \"economic uncertainty\" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[16] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[12]  The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to $500 million were canceled by buyers.[17]  These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[17] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[16]  In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[18] and was noted as having a valuation of about $11 billion.[19]  HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]\n",
      "In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its business which produced semiconductor integrated circuits (known as \"chips\") for consumer and industrial uses to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for $2.66 billion.[2]  This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate \"on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core,\" and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[2]  The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.\n",
      "Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for $1 billion.[2]  Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.\n",
      "Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[2] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy on the Nasdaq in mid-2006.\n",
      "In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX] in 2004. In 2011, the company, along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the \"Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center\".[20] Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[21]\n",
      "On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for $2.2 billion, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[22]\n",
      "On September 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent, a life sciences, diagnostics, and applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[23] The life sciences company retained the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company was called Keysight Technologies.[24] On October 14, 2014, the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[25] On November 1, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[3] Agilent announced it had completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies.
